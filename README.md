# GTA V Pounder Detection Script For A Roleplay Server

The script is designed to detect the in-game vehicle "Pounder" in GTA V using a trained machine learning model. It captures screenshots, processes them with OpenCV and Keras, and sends an alert to a Discord webhook when a Pounder is detected on the picture.
